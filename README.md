# DockerDemo
This repo shows the basics of Docker by letting you run a container that shows a basic GUI. If I understand correctly, we could run this exact same code on a Raspberry Pi and things would look the exact same. Below are the instructions to make the code in this repository work. 

## Clone the repo
Assuming you already have git installed (if not, go do that. It's easy), navigate to where you would like to put this code, and run this command:

'''
git clone https://github.com/elijahparker000/DockerDemo.git
'''
